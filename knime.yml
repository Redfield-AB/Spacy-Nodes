  This extension provides nodes that make the functionality of the spaCy library (https://spacy.io/) available in the KNIME Analytics Platform.
  You can select one of spaCy's pretrained pipelines and apply it to your text data to perform various textprocessing tasks from part-of-speech tagging to lemmatization.

  NOTE: The installation of this extension can fail on Windows if the installation folder of your Analytics Platform has a long path.
  This is due to Windows' long path limitations. You can circumvent this problem by enabling long path support as outlined here:
